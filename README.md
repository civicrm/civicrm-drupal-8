CiviCRM Drupal 8 Module
=======================

This is the integration module required to allow CiviCRM and Drupal 8 to work together. This is not the stable version yet.

For Views integration, please use: [civicrm_entity](https://github.com/eileenmcnaughton/civicrm_entity/tree/8.x-3.x). As per [dev/drupal#39](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/39), the views integration from this module will soon be removed.

Contribute
----------

If you want to contribute to the development of this module, please bear the following in mind:

* We currently do not have any automated testing setup on Drupal8, so please do a fair amount of testing.
* Many of the pull-request reviewers are not yet fully up to date on Drupal8. Please provide enough information so that we can understand the proposed change and the potential impacts.
* Any views pull-request will be closed, except if it's to remove the Views integration (c.f. [dev/drupal#39](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/39)).
* Please open issues on CiviCRM's Gitlab: https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/

If you have any questions, please join the [Drupal channel on CiviCRM's chat](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/drupal)

We are very grateful for the contributions so far, a lot of amazing work has been done already. The CiviCRM Drupal8 integration is almost ready and there are many organisations already using it in production. However, we also need to invest into improving some of the CiviCRM core bits that will make it easier to use Composer, improve our continuous integration and test coverage for Drupal, and fix a few remaining difficult issues that for now require various workarounds.

Please consider contribution financially to making an official Drupal8 release happen:
